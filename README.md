practicing HTML, Git with Odin

This is an Odin Project where I'll set up a simple site containing recipes.  With this project I will be practicing the following concepts:

1. site project folder creation/maintenance;
2. site pages and html boilerplate;
3. anchor tags with relative links to the project file pages;
4. github workflow;
